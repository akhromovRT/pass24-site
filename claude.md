# Shared agent instructions (single source of truth)
@AGENTS.md

# Claude Code extras (optional)
# - Add only what is Claude-specific and you don't want in AGENTS.md

# IMPORTANT: Do NOT edit this file to add project instructions.
# All project instructions live in AGENTS.md (universal rules) and agent_docs/ (topic-specific docs).
# This file is a thin pointer to AGENTS.md via @-import above.
# When updating project memory or capturing session learnings, edit AGENTS.md or the relevant file in agent_docs/.
# See agent_docs/index.md for the document map.
